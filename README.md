Stock Market Cash Trigger</br>
by Ian Kaplan</br>
</h2>

<p>
This notebook explores a stock market timing strategy that is described in David
Alan Carter's book <i>Stock Market Cash Trigger</i> (available as an Amazon Kindle book).
</p>
<p>
In the <i>Stock Market Cash Trigger</i> the 200-day moving average for the S&P 500
(the ETF SPY) close prices are compared with the current close SPY price. When the current
close price for SPY trends below the 200-day moving average, this is a
signal to move out of equity instruments into bond instruments. An ETF rotation strategy
is used to select a bond asset
(see the notebook <a href="https://github.com/IanLKaplan/twelve_percent/blob/master/twelve_percent.ipynb">
ETF Rotation</a>).
</p>
<p>
Perhaps the most famous proponent of the 200-day moving average as a market signal is the hedge
fund manager <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Tudor_Jones">Paul Tudor Jones</a>.
Consider also that Paul Tudor Jones has a lucky pair of gym shoes that he puts on when
trading gets rough.
